# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

- This Project was initiated to make a Study Guide
- Initial build of this project is to showcase the bare knowledge needed behind software development
- It can be easily accessed in case a problem arises in the future projects, a guide that can also be updated as seems fit
- Further practicing makes perfection. This simple project helped in computational thinking, decomposing code, psuedocoding, pattern recognition, debuggin, the ability to deploy. The layout of each individual scripts structual layout and the ability to manipulate each and every aspect of the site.
