        <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: Inline, Internal, External</li>
            <li>Inline is styling an element directly into the HTML file</li>
            <li>Inline applies directly to an HTML tag, styling a particular page element only</li>
            <li>Inline is useful for quick and permanent changes, but not as flexible as Internal or External</li>
            <li>Internal contains CSS rules within the HEAD of the HTML section of the HTML file</li>
            <li>External is a separate file which attaches to the main HTML file</li>
            <li>External makes design changes easier since all CSS rules are in a separate file</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an elemnt</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
            <li>A box-shadow is described by X and Y offsets, X axis to the right of the box, Y axis just below the box</li>
            <li>Colors can be assigned using semantics such as "gray" or "red" and can also be defined by its hexadecimal code or hex #</li>
